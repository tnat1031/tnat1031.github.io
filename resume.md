Professional Experience
----------

2012-present
:   **Computational Biologist** • *The Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA*

    *Previously:* Associate Computational Biologist, Research Associate

    As a member of the Connectivity Map ([CMap](http://clue.io)) group within the Broad’s Cancer Program, I serve as a lead data analyst and supervisor/mentor to junior analysts (1-2 direct reports) on projects utilizing data from the [L1000](https://clue.io/connectopedia/what_is_l1000) high-throughput gene expression profiling assay. Responsibilities and achievements include:

    * Lead analysis strategy and execution and aid in experimental design for internal and collaborative projects with academia and pharma in areas such as drug repurposing, drug discovery, and hit characterization.

    * Effectively visualize complex data and present analysis methods and results to scientific audiences in various domains.

    * Develop analysis methods for integrating L1000 data with other high-throughput readouts such as cell viability and cell morphology.

    * Lead efforts to structure and run crowdsourcing competitions which have resulted in improvements to 3 core CMap algorithms. 

    * Advance CMap software development projects by acting as computational liaison for software engineers.

    * Develop and maintain a library of CMap R code.

    * Accelerate L1000 assay development by assisting the data generation team with ad-hoc analyses.

    * Improved efficiency and reliability of the L1000 data processing pipeline by writing utilities in Python and leveraging automated scheduling utilities such as cron and Jenkins.

    * Improved L1000 data tracking and organization by implementing a LIMS database and web-based user interface to assist with managing the data production queue, tracking data generation batches, and easily viewing QC reports. 

    * Host office hours and lead technical support and outreach efforts within the CMap user community.

2009-2012
:    **Bioinformatics Scientist** • *Ligon Discovery in Cambridge, MA*

    *Previously:* Research Associate

    Led bioinformatics efforts for drug discovery in a high-throughput screening (HTS) setting by processing, managing, analyzing, and presenting data from small molecule microarray (SMM) and other biological assays. Specifically:

    * Increased SMM data analysis efficiency by building and implementing a pipeline using Perl and R. 
    
    * Designed, built, and administered a MySQL LIMS database.
    
    * Implemented and ran SMM hit-calling analyses using R.
    
    * Managed and executed SMM projects for clients according to specified timelines and presented corresponding analysis results.



2007-2009
:   **Biologist and Techincal Support Engineer** • *Hamilton Thorne, Inc. in Beverly, MA*

    * Independently conducted biological R&D experiments. 
    
    * Trained repair technicians and customers on proprietary Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) hardware and software and the applications thereof.
    
    * Performed mechanical, electrical and software validation, maintenance, and testing of CASA systems. 



2007
:   **Imaging Assistant** • *Perceptive Informatics (PAREXEL) in Waltham, MA*

    * Developed and coordinated clinical study-related activities in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
    
    * Used computer systems to convert medical image data to digital form.

    * Maintained a database of medical images and associated results.


Consulting
----------

2019
:   **Diamond Age Data Science** • *in Somerville, MA*

    Served as a consultant and advisor for a Diamond Age Data Science client on an analysis project involving public CMap data.


2016
:   **Navitor Pharmaceuticals** • *in Cambridge, MA*

    Performed differential expression analysis on microarray data to generate gene expression signatures of compounds.





Education
---------

2014 
:   **ALM, Biotechnology with Concentration in Bioinformatics**; Harvard Extension School (Cambridge, MA)

    *Thesis:* Implemented a full-stack web application for visualizing and analyzing CMap query results as a network graph.

2007
:   **BS, Biomedical Engineering**; Boston University (Boston, MA)
